This is wv2qt-0.4.2, see: http://wvware.sourceforge.net/
We slightly modified the code to meet our need.

To build libs ... take qt5 & cd to wv2qt path
qmake && make
at end
sudo make install
on error handle this..

this static lib only need iconv.. this is deal...  qt having all to manage other item
on Window .... hmm 


Ready to use on project:

LIBS   += -lz
LIBS   += -L/opt/icon/lib -liconv -I/opt/icon/include
LIBS   += -L/opt/icon/lib -lwv2qt -I/opt/icon/include
